# Autonomous-Rideshare-Planner-and-Controller
This project looks at performing optimal control and planning on an autonomous rideshare vehicle. Given the dynamic model of the car, the start and end location of the vehicle, the location of the stops, and the constraints of the map, this planner and controller is able to find the optimal route and vehicle dynamics.
